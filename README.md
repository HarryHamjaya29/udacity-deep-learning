## Assignments for Udacity Deep Learning class with TensorFlow

My own solutions to assigments for Udacity Deep Learning class with TensorFlow. 

I will be updating as i progress.

And the course information can be found at https://www.udacity.com/course/deep-learning--ud730

I use tensorflow with python-3. Thus, sometimes i make changes on the original notebook code lines to have it compatible with python-3.
